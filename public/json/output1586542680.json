{"action":"updated","security_advisory":{"ghsa_id":"GHSA-g4m9-5hpf-hx72","summary":"Firewall configured with unanimous strategy was not actually unanimous in Symfony","description":"Description\n-----------\n\nOn Symfony before 4.4.0, when a `Firewall` checks an access control rule (using the unanimous strategy), it iterates over all rule attributes and grant access only if *all* calls to the `accessDecisionManager` decide to grant access.\n\nAs of Symfony 4.4.0, a bug was introduced that prevents the check of attributes as soon as `accessDecisionManager` decide to grant access on one attribute.\n\nResolution\n----------\n\nThe `accessDecisionManager` is now called with all attributes at once, allowing the unanimous strategy being applied on each attribute. \n\nThe patch for this issue is available [here](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/c935e4a3fba6cc2ab463a6ca382858068d63cebf) for the 4.4 branch.\n\nCredits\n-------\n\nI would like to thank Antonio J. GarcÃ­a Lagar for reporting & Robin Chalas for fixing the issue.","severity":"high","identifiers":[{"value":"GHSA-g4m9-5hpf-hx72","type":"GHSA"},{"value":"CVE-2020-5275","type":"CVE"}],"references":[{"url":"https://github.com/symfony/symfony/security/advisories/GHSA-g4m9-5hpf-hx72"},{"url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-5275"},{"url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-g4m9-5hpf-hx72"}],"published_at":"2020-03-30T20:09:44Z","updated_at":"2020-04-10T18:17:29Z","withdrawn_at":null,"vulnerabilities":[{"package":{"ecosystem":"composer","name":"symfony/security"},"severity":"high","vulnerable_version_range":">= 4.4.0, < 4.4.7","first_patched_version":{"identifier":"4.4.7"}},{"package":{"ecosystem":"composer","name":"symfony/security"},"severity":"high","vulnerable_version_range":">= 5.0.0, < 5.0.7","first_patched_version":{"identifier":"5.0.7"}},{"package":{"ecosystem":"composer","name":"symfony/security-http"},"severity":"high","vulnerable_version_range":">= 4.4.0, < 4.4.7","first_patched_version":{"identifier":"4.4.7"}},{"package":{"ecosystem":"composer","name":"symfony/security-http"},"severity":"high","vulnerable_version_range":">= 5.0.0, < 5.0.7","first_patched_version":{"identifier":"5.0.7"}}]}}
